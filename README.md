# 🪐 Planetary Insight Engine
 
An advanced **Streamlit web app** for predicting planetary material composition using both **statistical** and **machine learning** models.



## 🚀 Features

- 🪐 **Planet Material Predictor**  
  Visually engaging interface with animated graphics and planetary theme.

- 📈 **Data Analysis Module**  
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), visualization, and insights driven by user-uploaded datasets.

- 📤 **Smart File Upload**  
  Intelligent upload system with feedback if no file is uploaded.

- 🧠 **Hybrid Modeling Approach**  
  Combines both **statistical models** (e.g., SARIMA) and **machine learning models** (e.g., Random Forest) for material prediction.

  

## 🧩 Modular Architecture

The project is divided into reusable components:
- app_sidebar.py – Sidebar navigation
- upload_page.py – Upload and parse datasets
- data_analysis.py – Handles exploratory data analysis
- mars_weather.py – Displays current Mars weather stats
- db_utils.py – Handles any backend or database logic
- style.css – Custom styles for visual appeal

  

## 🔍 Target Use Case

- Planetary science and astronomy students or researchers.
- Educational demonstrations for ML + space applications.
- Internal tool for data teams in space research startups.

## 🚧 Future Improvements

- Add model training from UI.
- Include database support for storing user sessions.
- Integrate NASA APIs for real-time planetary data.
- Enable deployment on cloud. (e.g., Streamlit Community Cloud, Azure, or AWS)
